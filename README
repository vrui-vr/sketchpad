Overview
========

SketchPad is a simple 2D vector drawing application for note taking,
math, etc. SketchPad is based on the Vrui software development toolkit
(see https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/Vrui), and is meant to
run on environments featuring touchscreens and/or styluses.

Requirements
============

SketchPad requires Vrui version 13.0 build 001 or newer.

Installation Guide
==================

It is recommended to download or move the source packages for Vrui and
SketchPad into a src directory underneath the user's home directory.
Otherwise, references to ~/src in the following instructions need to be
changed.

It is also recommended to skip optional steps 4 and 6 in the following
instructions. SketchPad does not need to be installed in order to be
used; installation (to a system directory such as /usr/local) is only
recommended if SketchPad will be used from multiple user accounts.

0. Install Vrui from ~/src/Vrui-<version> (see Vrui README file).

1. Change into ~/src directory and unpack the SketchPad tarball:
   > cd ~/src
   > tar xfz <download path>/SketchPad-<version>.tar.gz
   - or -
   > tar xf <download path>/SketchPad-<version>.tar

2. Change into SketchPad base directory:
   > cd SketchPad-<version>

3. If the Vrui version installed in step 0 was not 13.0, or Vrui's
   installation directory was changed from the default of /usr/local,
   adapt the makefile using a text editor. Change the value of
   VRUI_MAKEDIR close to the beginning of the file as follows:
   VRUI_MAKEDIR := <Vrui install dir>/share/make
   Where <Vrui install dir> is the installation directory chosen in
   step 0. Use $(HOME) to refer to the user's home directory instead
   of ~.

4. Optional: Adapt makefile if SketchPad is to be installed in a
   different location, for example /usr/local. Set INSTALLDIR to the
   desired target location. SketchPad will be then be installed in
   <INSTALLDIR>/bin, and its shaders will be installed in
   <INSTALLDIR>/share/Shaders (where <INSTALLDIR> is the value of
   INSTALLDIR set in the makefile).

5. Build SketchPad:
   > make
   This creates the SketchPad executables in ./bin.

6. Optional: Install SketchPad in the selected target location.
   This is only necessary if the INSTALLDIR variable in the makefile
   was changed. By default, SketchPad can be run from its base
   directory. To install:
   > make install
   - or, if the target location is a system directory -
   > sudo make install
   This will copy all executables into <INSTALLDIR>/bin, and the
   shader files into <INSTALLDIR>/share/Shaders.
